# Getting Started

<!-- TODO - How do we use the autobutler? -->

This page is a guide for how to use the various Autobutler products.

# Cirrus (Files)

![Cirrus Files](/assets/images/files.png)

Welcome to Cirrus! This is our bread-and-butter of what the Butler does - file exploration and management.

For the most part, we hope Cirrus is intuitive, fast, and easy to use. One of our favorite parts of using Cirrus
is that it's blazing-fast, because you have a single computer entirely dedicated to showing you your files, and
there's no network hops to manage - and no extra JavaScript to track what you're doing.

Cirrus has three different views: list, grid, and column.
