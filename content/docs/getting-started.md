# Getting Started

Welcome to AutoButler! This guide will help you get up and running quickly with our platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A modern web browser
- A basic level of comfort running commands in a terminal

## Quick Installation

To install autobutler, you simply need to download the binary for your hardware from
[our releases page](https://github.com/autobutler-org/autobutler.org/releases).

Once downloaded, you can extract the binary and run the `install` command with your
API key, and `sudo` privileges.

```bash
API_KEY="your-api-key"
sudo /path/to/autobutler install ${API_KEY}
```

If you wish to install it via `curl`, you can run the following command:

```bash
API_KEY="your-api-key"
OS="$(uname -s)"
ARCH="$(uname -m)"
curl --fail -L \
  "https://github.com/exokomodo/autobutler.org/releases/latest/download/autobutler_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz" | tar -xvz
sudo ./autobutler install "${API_KEY}"
```

or if you prefer to use `wget`, you can run:

```bash
API_KEY="your-api-key"
OS="$(uname -s)"
ARCH="$(uname -m)"
wget -qO- \
  "https://github.com/exokomodo/autobutler.org/releases/latest/download/autobutler_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz" | tar -xvz
sudo ./autobutler install "${API_KEY}"
```

Autobutler should now be running in the background, and you can check it out at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).
