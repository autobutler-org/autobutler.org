# Welcome to AutoButler

## What is AutoButler?

AutoButler is many things - the simplest way to explain it is like a Google Drive or iCloud service, but it lives
entirely inside your house. No big tech, no data outside of your home, just your files on your stuff in your house.

## How does AutoButler work securely?

You know how you can't use your home printer when you leave your WiFi network? Autobutler also works entirely
locally, meaning that public internet can't really access the Butler. (We are working on secure ways to access the
device from outside your home - for the nerds, this would be a reverse VPN going _into_ your home that only trusted
devices have installed) - but the short version is that the only traffic that can access your files has to come from
on your WiFi network. The technologies that your router uses to protect your devices work so well, most folks don't
know they even exist - which is the kind of security we kind of like using. Just make sure your WiFi is password
protected.

When you access the butler, all you're doing is asking your router to find the autobutler on your local network, as
you can see in the image above. The router does the hard work of figuring out which device is which - think of the
router like a post office, remembering which zip code is where. The only connection the butler makes with the outside
internet is the Update feature. Don't believe us? Our code is hosted online for free at
[our Github](https://github.com/autobutler-org/autobutler).

## How can we trust you guys?

Brandon here. First and foremost - this is a product for my parents. We don't take any money from venture
capitalists, we don't have any subscriptions (so we can't change pricing), and the way our stuff works is public on
the internet. We're active on our Reddit page at [r/autobutler](https://www.reddit.com/r/autobutler/) if you want to
talk to us or the community about concerns. The only price catch is if the hardware breaks, but we designed this so
that if you ever want to get a new device, your data is all backed up on your hard drives, so it should be a painless
1:1 swap.
