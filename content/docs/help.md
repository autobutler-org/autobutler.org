# Help & Support

Get assistance with AutoButler - troubleshooting, support tickets, and community resources. **The best way to get support for installing things yourself is to reach out to the community and developers on Reddit or Slack.**

# Troubleshooting

## I'm getting an error when I try to install AutoButler

Make sure you are using the correct installer for your operating system.

You can download the installer from the [AutoButler website](https://autobutler.org/docs/nerd-notes). 

## I'm not getting the right URL when I install at home

If you're doing this yourself, make sure your host name is `autobutler`, otherwise, whatever your hostname is will be the URL name of the device i.e. `my-computer.home.local`. 

## The Butler doesn't work with my VPN

This sort of defeats the purpose of running the butler in your house - if we put the Butler into the cloud (which is just other people's computers) then you would be accessing your data from outside of your house. Eventually we intend to build a VPN into the butler to help with accessing the device from outside of your home securely, but if they're clashing, you will have to access your own home network locally.

## I'm having performance issues with my AutoButler.

There is a button in the settings page that reads "Export Performance Metrics". This will save the last week or so of metrics (the data on the Health page) into a sqlite file called metrics.sqlite - you can send this to admin@autobutler.org and we can look at what is wrong.
